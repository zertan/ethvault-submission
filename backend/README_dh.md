Hi this is my submission for the backend integrating with the staking, governance, staked and reward token smart contracts.

We have added the Holsky testnet to env.

Start the backend normally after exporting the private key as below:

```bash
export PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
pnpm backend
```

Now curl the different new endpoints to interact with the Holesky deployed smart contracts, curl examples can be found in "backend/example_routes.sh".
